# TODO

### MANDATORY CORE (v0.1.0 - v0.3.0):
- [x] Daemon builder with fluent API
- [x] Cross-platform signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, Ctrl+C)
- [x] Graceful shutdown coordination with timeouts
- [x] Figment-based configuration system (TOML + env vars)
- [x] Tracing-based structured logging 
- [x] Subsystem management with shutdown handles
- [x] Error types with thiserror
- [x] Runtime-agnostic async (tokio/async-std features)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with timeout protection
- [x] Process health monitoring hooks
- [x] Memory pooling for frequent allocations
- [x] Zero-allocation hot paths
- [x] Production-ready error handling
- [x] Cross-platform file locking (prevent multiple instances)
- [x] Resource usage tracking (memory, CPU)

### ESSENTIAL ENTERPRISE (v0.3.0 - v0.6.0):
- [x] Configurable restart policies
- [x] Process supervision with restart limits
- [x] Advanced logging (JSON, filtering, rotation)
- [x] Configuration hot-reloading
- [x] Custom signal handler registration
- [ ] Metrics collection framework integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting hooks
- [ ] Memory limit enforcement
- [ ] Inter-process communication primitives
- [ ] Lock-free data structures for hot paths


### ADVANCED PERFORMANCE (v0.6.0 - v0.9.0): BETA
- [ ] Custom memory allocators
- [ ] Lock-free subsystem coordination
- [ ] NUMA-aware threading
- [ ] Zero-allocation configuration parsing
- [ ] Advanced profiling integration
- [ ] Custom scheduler hints
- [ ] Memory-mapped configuration files
- [ ] High-resolution timing APIs

### POST DEVELOPMENT(After v0.9.0 Tasks):
- [ ] Perform a full audit of the codebase for the following: 
    - [ ] Ensure all of the functionality and features are implemented.
    - [ ] Ensure best practices were followed.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is clean, modular, well-documented, and maintainable.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is is set for the highest possible performance.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is the highest efficiency possible.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is asynchronous, non-blocking, and thread-safe.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is robust, secure, and reliable.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is safe from bottlenecks.
    - [ ] Ensure the codebase is production-ready.
    - [ ] Check codebase for any remaining, possible, or potential issues.
    - [ ] Clean up any remaining, possible, or potential issues.
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests (unit, integration, performance, etc.) to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run clippy to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run fmt to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run audit to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run security audit to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run performance audit to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run resource audit to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Run documentation audit to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Clean &amp; Debug any remaining, possible, or potential issues (errors, warnings, lints, etc).
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes.
- [ ] Run Benchmarks - (also check resource metrics, and other indicators) for performance report.
- [ ] Update docs/PERFORMANCE.md with Benchmark data and metrics..
- [ ] Update docs/README.md with all changes.
